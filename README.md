1//This program can now only be run at windows system.

2//To get start, you need to adjust the path in Recite project (pathes were defined at infile and outfile) in order to let the program import the wordList or export the wordList.

3//You can change the threshold, to which reciting style will change when the number of remnant words decreased. The remnant words at the threshold number will shuffle endlessly, untill you can remember all the words at one course.

4//We use "#" to split different explanations for one word.
